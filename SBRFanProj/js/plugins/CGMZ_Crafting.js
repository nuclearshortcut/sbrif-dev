 * Version: 1.11.1
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Compatibility: Only tested with my CGMZ plugins.
 * Made for RPG Maker MZ 1.9.0
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Description: Adds a crafting system to your game that works well with CGMZ
 * Professions. It can handle item requirements (consumed on craft), tool
 * requirements (not consumed on craft), products (produced on craft success)
 * and fail products (produced on craft fail). Recipes can be discovered by 
 * using an item or via plugin command.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Documentation:
 * --------------------------Crafting In/Output--------------------------------
 * Recipes have 4 categories of items associated with them: "Products", "Fail
 * Products", "Tools", and "Ingredients".
 * - Products are items that are received by the player directly into the
 *   inventory on a successful craft.
 * - Fail Products are items that are received by the player directly into the
 *   inventory on a failed craft. This is an optional parameter.
 * - Tools are items that are required to craft the recipe, but which are NOT
 *   consumed on craft.
 * - Ingredients are items that are required to craft the recipe, and are
 *   consumed on craft.
 * --------------------------High Quality Crafts-------------------------------
 * Recipes can also have high quality craft results if high quality products
 * are set up. These are special products that occur only in the case the
 * player both succeeds the craft (did not fail the craft) and rolled a second
 * high quality check to see if the craft outcome is a high quality craft.
 *
 * High quality craft items functions similar to regular product items.
 * --------------------------Generic Item Types--------------------------------
 * Recipes can use "generic item types" for their ingredients or tools. What
 * this means is that if you need a "skillet" tool to craft an "omelet", you
 * could designate your "iron skillet" and "steel skillet" as a "skillet" type
 * item, and then either could be used to craft the "omelet".
 *
 * See note tag section for setting an item's type.
 *
 * Caution: Care should be taken if an item belongs to multiple generic
 * categories and the recipe uses multiple generic categories, as the item
 * could be double counted when calculating the amount of items the player has.
 * ----------------------------Unique Products---------------------------------
 * Unique products are products which can only be crafted up until the player
 * has the Product Unique Amount of that item in their inventory. For example,
 * you could make the Ultimate Sword which has a Product Unique Amount of 1,
 * which would mean players can only craft 1 of these swords (at least, until 
 * the first sword is no longer in their party's inventory).
 * 
 * Unique products only support item/weapon/armors. You cannot use unique
 * products to restrict currency or generic item products. Unique Products are
 * only for products, not fail products.
 * -------------------------------Note Tags------------------------------------
 * You can make items that, when used, will cause a recipe to be learned.
 * To do so, put the following tag in its notebox:
 * <cgmzrecipe:RecipeName>
 * And replace RecipeName with the name of the recipe.
 *
 * You can make weapons or armors that, when equipped, will add to a recipe
 * success chance. To do so, put the following note tags in the equip notebox:
 * <cgmzrecipetype:ProfessionName>
 * <cgmzrecipebonus:BonusAmount>
 *
 * You can make "generic" types of items/weapons/armors to be used as either
 * ingredients or tools. To do so, enter the following note tag into any
 * item/armor/weapon notebox:
 * <cgmzcraftinggeneric:GenericType,GenericType2,etc>
 * Caution: Please be aware that generics can ONLY be used for ingredients or
 *          tools!
 *
 * Note: When typing a note tag, it is CASE SENSITIVE which means that
 *       "Cooking" is not the same as "cOOking"
 * -----------------------------Toast Manager----------------------------------
 * In your toast presets, you can use the text code %name to show the recipe
 * name in your toast.
 * --------------------------------Filters-------------------------------------
 * This plugin has the option to allow your player to filter the current list
 * of crafting recipes they are looking at. The following filter types are
 * available:
 *
 * Category Filter
 * This filter is only available if not already using the Category window. To
 * use it, type the categories you want to be available to filter by and 
 * ensure they match the recipe's Profession parameters.
 *
 * Subcategory Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Subcategory it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the subcategory.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the subcategory "Spices", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Spices
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter subcategory will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Spices
 *
 * Quality Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Quality it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the quality.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the quality "Common", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Common
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter quality will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Common
 * -------------------------------Scene Keys-----------------------------------
 * The plugin command that includes scene keys help differentiate crafting
 * scenes. By default, once something is crafting, it cannot have another
 * craft of the same item start. However, if the scene key is different
 * between the two scenes, it will be recognized as a different item and you
 * can craft multiple of the same craft at once.
 *
 * Scene keys can also come in handy when checking if a specific crafting
 * station is currently crafting something. Note that it is important your
 * scene key is something unique, and should not be "crafting" or match a
 * recipe's name.
 * ----------------------------Plugin Commands---------------------------------
 * This plugin supports the following commands:
 * • Discover
 * Discovers (or undiscovers) the given recipe by name
 * 
 * • Call Scene
 * Calls the crafting scene. Specify a profession type (case sensitive) to only
 * include certain recipes in the scene.
 *
 * • Is Scene Crafting
 * Check if the scene with the provided scene key is currently crafting a
 * recipe. Sets a game switch to TRUE/FALSE based on result of the check, for
 * use in eventing.
 * 
 * • Set Description
 * Changes the given recipe's description
 * 
 * • Reinitialize
 * Reinitializes crafting data as if you had started a new game.
 * ------------------------Calling the Scene-----------------------------------
 * The JS to call the scene is: SceneManager.push(CGMZ_Scene_Crafting);
 * You can also prepare the crafting scene to show only certain recipes with:
 * SceneManager.prepareNextScene(["Type", "Type2"]);
 * -----------------------------Saved Games------------------------------------
 * This plugin partially supports saved games. Adding new recipes is supported,
 * but removing or modifying existing recipes is not supported. This is
 * because everything is saved when the game is saved. Any issues with
 * removed/modified recipes will only occur in previously saved games.
 *
 * Generic Item Info supports saved games completely, you can add/edit/remove
 * generic item information in saved games. However, the generic item type in
 * the recipe parameters does not support saved games.
 * -----------------------------Filename---------------------------------------
 * The filename for this plugin MUST remain CGMZ_Crafting.js
 * This is what it comes as when downloaded. The filename is used to load
 * parameters and execute plugin commands. If you change it, things will begin
 * behaving incorrectly and your game will probably crash. Please do not
 * rename the js file.
 * --------------------------Latest Version------------------------------------
 * Hi all, this latest version improves the [CGMZ] Toast Manager integration
 * since it now uses toast presets which are re-usable by a toast id, and all
 * you need to enter here is the id with all the other options coming from the
 * toast manager. You can use the string %name to show the recipe name in your
 * toast presets.

 * ============================================================================
 * 【插件版本】V 1.11.1
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 【兼容性】仅测试作者所制作的插件
 * 【RM版本】RPG Maker MZ 1.9.0
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 【插件描述】
 * 功能全面的传统物品合成插件。
 * 通过设置配方的材料和工具，来合成获得产物，或得到废品。
 * 可以通过合成来领悟新的配方。
 * 可以设定和使用相同属性工具或材料作为合成替代品。
 * 可以使用物品或触发事件来获取配方。
 *
 * 【搭配插件】
 * CGMZ Core:核心插件，运行作者插件的必须插件。
 * CGMZ Toast Manager:提示插件，提示配方得失，专业技能升级等。
 * CGMZ Profession:专业插件，用专业等级作为合成条件，获得经验升级和提高成功率等。 
 * 注：本插件在插件列表中必须置于"核心插件Core"和"提示插件Toast Manager"之下。
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 【使用说明】
 *
 * 一、配方设置（4个主要项目）
 *   1.产物：合成成功的产物，可以设置多种产物和不同数量。
 *   2.废品：合成失败的产物，可以不设置。
 *   3.工具：合成所需工具，需持有但不会消耗。可以不设置。
 *   4.材料：合成所需的物品，合成时会被消耗。
 *       注：以上项目可以设置为：物品/武器/防具/金钱。
 *   5.专业：定义配方的类型，在打开合成界面时使用。
 *       注：如果配合专业插件，可以拓展以专业等级作为合成条件。
 *   6.领悟：在合成时，有几率获得新的配方。
 *
 * 二、物品属性和合成次数（1.4.0新增功能）
 *   1.可以定义作为材料或工具的物品/武器/防具的属性。
 *     拥有相同属性的物品可以在配方合成时作为替代品。
 *     尽量避免一个配方中的一个物品有多种属性的设置。（详细设置见备注指令的说明）
 *     举例1：制作皮革需要剥皮刀工具，铁刀、银刀、金刀均为剥皮刀属性的物品，
 *            拥有其中之一即可制作皮革配方。
 *     举例2：制作沙拉需要5个蔬菜属性的物品，
 *            你可以使用同为蔬菜属性的白菜和番茄来制作，满足材料需求数量即可。
 *            同类物品会按照物品ID顺序从小到大消耗。
 *   2.可以获取某个配方的成功合成次数作为变量在游戏中使用。
 *
 * 三、备注指令（在物品/武器/防具设置界面备注栏输入）
 *   1.制作使用后可获得配方的物品：
 *     <cgmzrecipe:配方名称>
 *   2.制作装备后提高合成成功率百分比的武器或防具：
 *     <cgmzrecipetype:配方名称>
 *     <cgmzrecipebonus:提升数值>
 *   3.定义工具或材料的属性
 *     <cgmzcraftinggeneric:属性1, 属性2, 属性3等>
 *     注：只能定义工具或材料，产物和废品无效。
 *
 * 四、插件指令（事件中使用插件指令）
 *   1.打开菜单：打开合成菜单显示已获得的配方。
 *               设置一种或多种专业，则可以同时打开所选专业对应的配方。
 *               不设置则打开所有已获得配方。
 *   2.获得配方：设置获得或失去配方。
 *   3.修改描述：修改一个配方的备注描述。
 *   4.重置数据：调试用指令，重置合成数据到新游戏开始状态。
 * 
 * 五、脚本指令（事件中运行脚本指令）
 *   1.打开合成界面：SceneManager.push(CGMZ_Scene_Crafting);
 *   2.打开指定专业的合成界面：SceneManager.prepareNextScene(["专业1", "专业2"]);
 * 
 * 六、关于所有设置中的配方名称、物品属性、专业名称：
 *     字符必须一致，并区分大小写。如Cooking和cooKING会定义为不同的配方或专业。
 *
 * 七、关于插件对已保存游戏的支持。
 *     大概意思是支持加入新配方，不支持配方修改或删除。
 *     不太明白，请各位参考原文。
 *     This plugin partially supports saved games. Adding new recipes is supported,
 *     but removing or modifying existing recipes is not supported. This is
 * 	   because everything is saved when the game is saved. Any issues with
 *     removed/modified recipes will only occur in previously saved games.
 * --------------------------High Quality Crafts-------------------------------
 * Recipes can also have high quality craft results if high quality products
 * are set up. These are special products that occur only in the case the
 * player both succeeds the craft (did not fail the craft) and rolled a second
 * high quality check to see if the craft outcome is a high quality craft.
 *
 * High quality craft items functions similar to regular product items.
 * ----------------------------Unique Products---------------------------------
 * Unique products are products which can only be crafted up until the player
 * has the Product Unique Amount of that item in their inventory. For example,
 * you could make the Ultimate Sword which has a Product Unique Amount of 1,
 * which would mean players can only craft 1 of these swords (at least, until 
 * the first sword is no longer in their party's inventory).
 * 
 * Unique products only support item/weapon/armors. You cannot use unique
 * products to restrict currency or generic item products. Unique Products are
 * only for products, not fail products.
 * -------------------------------Scene Keys-----------------------------------
 * The plugin command that includes scene keys help differentiate crafting
 * scenes. By default, once something is crafting, it cannot have another
 * craft of the same item start. However, if the scene key is different
 * between the two scenes, it will be recognized as a different item and you
 * can craft multiple of the same craft at once.
 *
 * Scene keys can also come in handy when checking if a specific crafting
 * station is currently crafting something. Note that it is important your
 * scene key is something unique, and should not be "crafting" or match a
 * recipe's name.
 * --------------------------------Filters-------------------------------------
 * This plugin has the option to allow your player to filter the current list
 * of crafting recipes they are looking at. The following filter types are
 * available:
 *
 * Category Filter
 * This filter is only available if not already using the Category window. To
 * use it, type the categories you want to be available to filter by and 
 * ensure they match the recipe's Profession parameters.
 *
 * Subcategory Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Subcategory it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the subcategory.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the subcategory "Spices", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Spices
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter subcategory will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Spices
 *
 * Quality Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Quality it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the quality.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the quality "Common", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Common
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter quality will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Common
 * -----------------------------Toast Manager----------------------------------
 * In your toast presets, you can use the text code %name to show the recipe
 * name in your toast.
 * -----------------------------Filename---------------------------------------
 * The filename for this plugin MUST remain CGMZ_Crafting.js
 * This is what it comes as when downloaded. The filename is used to load
 * parameters and execute plugin commands. If you change it, things will begin
 * behaving incorrectly and your game will probably crash. Please do not
 * rename the js file.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *【版本更新历史】
 * Hi all, this latest version improves the [CGMZ] Toast Manager integration
 * since it now uses toast presets which are re-usable by a toast id, and all
 * you need to enter here is the id with all the other options coming from the
 * toast manager. You can use the string %name to show the recipe name in your
 * toast presets.
 *
 * Version 1.11.1
 * - [CGMZ] Toast Manager integration now uses toast preset id

 * ============================================================================
 * Versión: 1.11.1
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Compatibilidad: Sólo probado con mis CGMZ plugins.
 * Hecho para RPG Maker MZ 1.9.0
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Descripción: Agrega un sistema de creación a tu juego que funciona bien con 
 * CGMZ Professions. Puede manejar los requisitos de artículos (consumidos en 
 * la elaboración), los requisitos de herramientas (no consumidos en la
 * elaboración), los productos (producidos con éxito en la elaboración) y los 
 * productos  defectuosos (producidos en la elaboración fallida). Las recetas 
 * se pueden  descubrir usando un elemento o mediante un comando de plugin.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Documentación:
 * -----------------------Partidas guardadas-----------------------------------
 * Este plugin admite parcialmente juegos guardados. Se admite la adición de 
 * nuevas recetas, pero no se admite la eliminación o modificación de recetas
 * existentes. Esto se debe a que todo se guarda cuando se guarda el juego. 
 * Cualquier problema con recetas eliminadas/modificadas solo ocurrirá en  
 * juegos guardados previamente. 
 *
 * La información de elementos genéricos admite juegos guardados por completo,
 * puede agregar/editar/eliminar información de elementos genéricos en los 
 * juegos guardados. Sin embargo, el tipo de artículo genérico en los 
 * parámetros de la receta no admite partidas guardadas.
 * --------------------Elaboración de entrada/salida---------------------------
 * Las recetas tienen 4 categorías de elementos asociados a ellas: "Productos",
 * "Productos fallidos", "Herramientas" e "Ingredientes".
 * - Los productos son artículos que el jugador recibe directamente en el 
 *   inventario en una elaboración exitosa.
 * - Los productos fallidos son elementos que el jugador recibe directamente
 *   en el inventario de una nave fallida. Este es un parámetro opcional.
 * - Las herramientas son elementos necesarios para elaborar la receta, pero
 *   que NO se consumen en la elaboración.
 * - Los ingredientes son elementos necesarios para elaborar la receta y se 
 *   consumen en la elaboración.
 * --------------------------High Quality Crafts-------------------------------
 * Recipes can also have high quality craft results if high quality products
 * are set up. These are special products that occur only in the case the
 * player both succeeds the craft (did not fail the craft) and rolled a second
 * high quality check to see if the craft outcome is a high quality craft.
 *
 * High quality craft items functions similar to regular product items.
 * ----------------------Tipos de artículos genéricos--------------------------
 * Las recetas pueden usar "tipos de elementos genéricos" para sus ingredientes
 * o herramientas. Lo que esto significa es que si necesita una herramienta de 
 * "sartén" para elaborar una "tortilla", puede designar su "sartén de hierro"
 * y su "sartén de acero" como un elemento de tipo "sartén", y luego cualquiera
 * podría usarse para elaborar la "tortilla".
 *
 * Consulte la sección de etiquetas de notas para configurar el tipo de
 * elemento.
 *
 * Precaución: Se debe tener cuidado si un artículo pertenece a varias
 * categorías genéricas y la receta usa varias categorías genéricas, ya que el
 * artículo podría contarse dos veces al calcular la cantidad de artículos que
 * tiene el jugador.
 * --------------------------Etiquetas de notas--------------------------------
 * Puedes hacer artículos que, cuando se usan, harán que se aprenda una receta.
 * Para hacerlo, coloque la siguiente etiqueta en su notebox:
 * <cgmzrecipe:RecipeName>
 * Y reemplace RecipeName con el nombre de la receta.
 *
 * Puedes hacer armas o armaduras que, cuando estén equipadas, aumentarán la 
 * probabilidad de éxito de una receta. Para hacerlo, coloque las siguientes 
 * etiquetas de notas en el cuadro de notas del equipo:
 * <cgmzrecipetype:ProfessionName>
 * <cgmzrecipebonus:BonusAmount> 
 *
 * Puedes hacer tipos "genéricos" de artículos/armas/armaduras para usar como 
 * ingredientes o herramientas. Para hacerlo, ingrese la siguiente etiqueta de
 * nota en cualquier caja de notas de artículo/armadura/arma:
 * <cgmzcraftinggeneric:GenericType,GenericType2,etc>
 * Precaución: ¡Tenga en cuenta que los genéricos SOLO pueden usarse para 
 * ingredientes o herramientas!
 *
 * Nota: Al escribir una etiqueta de nota, se distingue entre mayúsculas y 
 * minúsculas, lo que significa que "Cocinar" no es lo mismo que "cOOcinar".
 * --------------------------------Filters-------------------------------------
 * This plugin has the option to allow your player to filter the current list
 * of crafting recipes they are looking at. The following filter types are
 * available:
 *
 * Category Filter
 * This filter is only available if not already using the Category window. To
 * use it, type the categories you want to be available to filter by and 
 * ensure they match the recipe's Profession parameters.
 *
 * Subcategory Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Subcategory it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the subcategory.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the subcategory "Spices", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Spices
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter subcategory will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Spices
 *
 * Quality Filter
 * This filter is always available if enabled. To use it, you need to set up
 * which category (or all) it should show up for as well as the specific
 * recipe Quality it should match. To do this, use a colon ":" to separate
 * the category from the quality.
 *
 * For example, if you had a recipe of category (profession) "Cooking" and you
 * wanted to be able to filter that category by the quality "Common", you
 * would make your filter entry: Cooking:Common
 *
 * This supports "All" for the category where the filter quality will
 * always appear no matter which category is selected. For example: All:Common
 * -------------------------------Scene Keys-----------------------------------
 * The plugin command that includes scene keys help differentiate crafting
 * scenes. By default, once something is crafting, it cannot have another
 * craft of the same item start. However, if the scene key is different
 * between the two scenes, it will be recognized as a different item and you
 * can craft multiple of the same craft at once.
 *
 * Scene keys can also come in handy when checking if a specific crafting
 * station is currently crafting something. Note that it is important your
 * scene key is something unique, and should not be "crafting" or match a
 * recipe's name.
 * ------------------------Comandos de Plugin----------------------------------
 * Este plugin admite los siguientes comandos:
 * • Descubrir
 * Descubre (o no descubre) la receta dada por su nombre
 *
 * • Escena de llamada
 * Llama a la escena de elaboración. Especifique un tipo de profesión
 * (distingue entre mayúsculas y minúsculas) para incluir solo ciertas 
 * recetas en la escena.
 *
 * • Is Scene Crafting
 * Check if the scene with the provided scene key is currently crafting a
 * recipe. Sets a game switch to TRUE/FALSE based on result of the check, for
 * use in eventing.
 *
 * • Descripción del conjunto
 * Cambia la descripción de la receta dada.
 *
 * • Reinicializar
 * Reinicializa los datos de elaboración como si hubieras comenzado un nuevo
 * juego.
 * ------------------------Llamando a la escena--------------------------------
 * El JS para llamar a la escena es: SceneManager.push(CGMZ_Scene_Crafting);
 * También puedes preparar la escena de elaboración para mostrar solo ciertas 
 * recetas con:
 * SceneManager.prepareNextScene(["Type", "Type2"]);
 * ----------------------------Unique Products---------------------------------
 * Unique products are products which can only be crafted up until the player
 * has the Product Unique Amount of that item in their inventory. For example,
 * you could make the Ultimate Sword which has a Product Unique Amount of 1,
 * which would mean players can only craft 1 of these swords (at least, until 
 * the first sword is no longer in their party's inventory).
 * 
 * Unique products only support item/weapon/armors. You cannot use unique
 * products to restrict currency or generic item products. Unique Products are
 * only for products, not fail products.
 * -----------------------------Toast Manager----------------------------------
 * In your toast presets, you can use the text code %name to show the recipe
 * name in your toast.
 * -----------------------------Filename---------------------------------------
 * The filename for this plugin MUST remain CGMZ_Crafting.js
 * This is what it comes as when downloaded. The filename is used to load
 * parameters and execute plugin commands. If you change it, things will begin
 * behaving incorrectly and your game will probably crash. Please do not
 * rename the js file.
 * --------------------------Latest Version------------------------------------
 * Hi all, this latest version improves the [CGMZ] Toast Manager integration
 * since it now uses toast presets which are re-usable by a toast id, and all
 * you need to enter here is the id with all the other options coming from the
 * toast manager. You can use the string %name to show the recipe name in your
